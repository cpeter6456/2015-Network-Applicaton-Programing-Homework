UDP‐based FTP service

use	the	UDP	sendto() and recvfrom() system calls to transfer	
a file from	a UDP client  to a UDP server

To	create	the	datagram dropping environment, when your server receives a UDP datagram, you server	
can	intentionally drop it (acts	as	if	the	datagram were not received at all) based on	
a probability using	the	random() procedure.	You	have to	do fragmentation before	
sending	the	file. The size of each fragment	is	set	to	1KB	(1024	bytes).	 	


Your server should be aware of such dropping ONLY when it receives the“next”	
datagram from the client. In other words, although the server intentionally	drops	
a datagram,	it pretends	not	to know	such a behavior.

Server  and	 Clients Need necessary messages to indicate the behaviors of datagram loss and retransmission

StarTime : 5/22 9:00 pm

DeadLine : 5/27



How To Run : 
	Run Server it will wait Client data , then run Client to transmit File,

Server open 7777 port

How To Write:
server and clients should show some necessary messagest 
to indicate the behaviors of datagram loss and retransmission:

	Server:
		have printf("Before packet drop , FileSequence = %d\n",FileSequence) when know last loss

	Client:
		if(RecBuf.AckSequence < CliSequence)
			printf("Occur at Server Know that before packet have loss\n");

		//Problem : Server loss packet  at FileEnd
		if(feof(FilePtr) && LastServerAckNumber < CliSequence)
			End Check !! LastServerAckNumber
