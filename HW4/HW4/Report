UDP‐based FTP service


To	create	the	datagram dropping environment, when your server receives a UDP datagram, you server	
can	intentionally drop it (acts	as	if	the	datagram were not received at all) based on	
a probability using	the	random() procedure.	You	have to	do fragmentation before	
sending	the	file. The size of each fragment	is	set	to	1KB	(1024	bytes).	 	


Your server should be aware of such dropping ONLY when it receives the“next”	
datagram from the client. In other words, although the server intentionally	drops	
a datagram,	it pretends	not	to know	such a behavior.

Server  and	 Clients Need necessary messages to indicate the behaviors of datagram loss and retransmission

Report:

	At First , I Think maybe can use Ack&Timer in client , if no ACK and timeout then Client retransmit
But In HW ,it say use an acknowledgement solutionit and Server know loss when next come ,
so not Client know at first And Client should think Server have receive "the packet drop in server" 
at default !!!

	This HW is use UDP like TCP , So  I think simple struct like Server is one rec one send , 
and Client is one send one rec (not send all at one time), but if server not send when loss , 
Client will wait untill forever.

	So , implement it when packet come but drop it in server , and Server send "next packt(not Ack)" and 
FileSequence not ++ , so Client think Server have receive at default !!! , then Client trans next
When Server accept next packet , it will send Ack(with loss sequence) , then Client know Server loss
Then Client retransmit loss packet

	If not loss Server will send ACK(wilt accept packet sequence) , then Client receive and check 
With Client's sequence and know , not loss at before and this packet had accept ,
Then Client send Next packet


Problem : 
	Server loss packet  at FileEnd


Solution :
	 of Server loss packet at FileEnd packet
CliEndCheck is only at Client fin , but know Server not
(because Server's Ack sequence not enough,use LastServerAckNumber)

if(fseek(FilePtr, (CliSequence-1)*DATA_BUF_SIZE , SEEK_SET) !=0 ){
	perror("fseek3");exit(1);
}

CliEndCheck should be initionlize , or it will loop


After Complete This HW , I think maybe I can let Client use LastServerAckNumber to check every IsAck == 1
and if LastServerAckNumber != CliSequence , then Retransmit Packet(LastServerAckNumber+1)
